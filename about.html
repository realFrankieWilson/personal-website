                <h3>My Journey: From Wires to Web</h3>
                <p>My professional journey began in the dynamic world of electrical work, where I honed my skills in
                    practical problem-solving, meticulous execption, and understanding complex systems. While I don't
                    hold a formal degree yet, years of hands-on experience on various electrical projects have instilled
                    in me a deep appreciation for precision, efficiencey, and safty.</p>
                <p>This same passion for building and optimizing led me to explore software engineering. I embarked on a
                    rigorous foundational program, where I gained a solid understanding of core programming concepts and
                    various languages. My goal is tomerge my practical engineering mindset with software development to
                    create robust, reliable, and user-centric applications.</p>

                <h3>Technical Foundations & Learning Agility</h3>
                <p>My foundational program has equiped me with a grasp of several key technolgies and programming
                    paradigms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, Python, Typescript</li>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> MYSQL (basic understanding)</li>
                    <li><strong>Core Concepts:</strong> Foundational knowlege in algorithms, data structures, object-oriented
                        programming (OPP), and software development methodologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Foundational knowlege in Flask, Node.js, Bootstrap, and Django </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I am actively building upon this foundation, embracing new challenges and expanding my skill set. My
                    learning philosophy is hands-on, always seeking to apply new knowlege to real-world problems and
                    projects</p>

                <h3>Soft Skills & Professional Approach</h3>
                <p>Beyond technical aptitude, I bring a suite of soft skills crucial for any professional environment:
